The ending, the change in the protagonist's goals and his realizations about his own actions were very satisfying.Additionally, I found the free Kindle edition to be adequate and free from distracting format errors or other issues.\",\n",

Nice, but what if you want both sets of remote speakers on at the same time? Well, both remote speakers can be on at the same time when both buttons are pushed in simultaneously, but then you have to jiggle them all over the place to get the buttons to pop back out and turn the speakers off again.

We send music to it via an Apple Airport Express on one channel, and run the sound from our Roku XD streaming device on the second channel.So far it has worked our really well. I'm no audiophile, but it sounds great to my ears. I really like that you never have to turn it on or off, or select between input channels. It has no hum, and doesn't seem to heat up at all. Sweet amp for the money.\",\n",
       " \"AudioSource Amp 100 2-Channel Power Amplifier: I like this product. It's low profile and a great value. I connected a radio and cd player to it. The radio should kick out automatically once the CD player starts. My only minor complaint is the radio doesn't kick out until the sound output from the CD is high enough. I once played a CD that has a very quiet passage at the beginning, it didn't switch over until it got louder. If you are just looking for a great amp that you technically declined spouse or significant other can't comprehend, this is the amp for you. The auto power feature on is great. The sound is very clean and faithful. I do wish it had a subwoofer out. That would make it perfect for me.\",\n",

So far, it is performing in a most satisfactory manner and is doing exactly what I purchased it to do. I also use it alone with the Focals when recording albums and cassettes to CD, when I do not need to use my McIntosh amp and Phase Technology 10.5 Phase Coherent speakers. It does not run hot even when being pushed, and has shown no signs of clipping at moderately high volume levels. If it is hooked up correctly and manufacturer reccomendations are followed, I see no reason for problems some other reviewers encountered.\",\n",

As well I wanted to be able to use a single hook up to play my iPod on all sets of speakers. So I saw that this unit had not only an ability to power additional speakers but also an ability to do so in such a way that I could use this unit as an input to the Kenwood receiver.

No one has complained of insufficient volume. (Someone wrote that there is a line-in sensitivity adjustment or a max gain adjustment or the like, but I cannot find it.) A preamp with a 3- or 4-volt line out would solve this problem and add needed spectrum control, but at greatly increased cost. You can power either of two pairs of speaker connections but not both; the spec sheet is a little vague on this point.

James then disappears after being attacked and is also suspected of murdering his rumored mistress, Melissa. Agatha, ever the amateur sleuth, is anxious to solve the crime and also clear her husband\\'s name. She sets off with her old friend, Sir Charles, to do both. In addition to amateur sleuthing in the quaint villages around the Cotswolds, Agatha is grappling with getting older and feels \"the autumn of her life stretching in front of her.\" We will have to wait for book #12 to find out how Agatha is coping with being single again.',\n",

Donizetti's music, as always is so melodic you can close your eyes, sit back and soar!

But honestly, this is really a relevant CD for anyone interested in decent mainstream pop music. Bjork can turn her limits (naive vocal technique, an icelandic accent you could cut with a knife) into peculiar qualities. She is unique in her ability to couple unusual harmonic passages with quirk turns of phrase and superb arrangements. This album defies classification -- there\\'s big-band jazz, trip-hop, electronic dance, \"sugarcubes\", trance, soundtrack-like strings, even traces of Abba\\'s notorius pop. This is an album that has not created a genre like \"Dummy\" by Portishead, but is vastly superior to it and many other for its musicality, originality, literary quality and sense of humor. \"Homogenic\" is equally good, but much more tense and influenced by the Bristol scene.',\n",

Hyper-ballad is aclassical Björk song, following her innovative (but today very imitated) mixture of strings and electronic noises and melodies which began with Venus As A Boy, and the song is a real poem where she creates images of suicide thoughts. The Modern Thingsis another impressive electronic track, and It's Oh So Quiet her most successful single ever, a cover of a jazz classic where she really reinvinted the song and gave it a totally new and unexpected interpretation. Other pearls are Cover Me, Possibly Maybe, Headphones, Isobel, You've Been Flirting Again, evry one a totally different, lyric and strangely melodic track.Post is a classic.\",\n",

It seems she is trying something specifically unique on each track.I find 'Post' slightly more innovative and interesting than 'Debut', although both CDs are great. Of this bunch, my favs are, in order: Possibly Maybe, Isobel, Army of Me, Cover Me, Hyper Ballad and Enjoy, so the Amazon provided clips cover only half the good ones!

In a way her melodic innovation here is as starlingly beautiful as that of the beloved Beatles.',\n",

Each song has a different tone, emotion, and musical arrangement from the techno beat of \"Hyperballad\" to the stark sounds and keyboards of \"Possibly Maybe\" to the drum beat and screams in \"I Miss You.\" Bjork\\'s tireless voice is beautiful and full of energy- it growls, screams, slides, whispers.

My only disappointments are that it runs for less than an hour, there are no extras on the disc and information about the gig and musicians is almost non-existent.

       " \"One Of Shakespeare's More Challenging Works: Cymbeline is one of the later Shakespeare plays that is rarely staged and probably even as rarely read. The plot has elements that are familiar from several of the earlier works and many of the characters borrow from more familiar characters in other plays as well. Nevertheless, Cymbeline is a rewarding play to either view or read. The Arden version that I recently read was useful but for the footnotes which focused on various usages and interpretations of the language over time which I found distracting and finally chose to just ignore. The play itself because of the familiar elements will appeal to those who have read the better known works. Cymbeline revolves around a layered plot that includes the devices of mistaken identity, evil and deception , unbridled ambition and political intrigue. It is a rather long play with 5 acts and 27 scenes. Having the benefit of seeing this well staged would enhance the reader's experience.\",\n",

       " \"BEST PICTURE QUALITY AND HAS ANTENNA HOOK UP!: This product works great for the N64 if you need a cord with a coaxel to the back of your tv. Very hard to find locally. Wanted to play Goldeneye and Super Mario 64, as well as WWF No Mercy for nastalga purposes and let me tell ya, the picture quality was great. This is by far the best cord on the market. I had bought 2 from amazon because it was very hard to tell from the pictures if this had the cord to go where the cable cord goes in the back of the tv. It does and it works and functions great on my 55 inch HDTV. the other cord I bought didn't have the same picture quality. Thanks NyKo!!\",\n",

       " \"Very Nice Sound in a Compact Clock Radio: To my unsophisticated ear the Recepter's sound is full and rich. I like the way they've implemented the station pre-sets. They're accessed via a rotary knob, not a lot of hard to find buttons, and you can mix AM and FM stations among then presets. The clock radio shuts itself off after 10 minutes and can be combined with an alarm. In general, I like the Recepter's controls and user interface. I also own a Kloss Model One, another outstanding piece of equipment, and the Recepter has comparable sound quality, which is saying a lot. The Recepter has the edge in ease of use and the Model One lacks a clock radio. One drawback, the Receptor lacks an audio-in jack, so you can't attach an IPod. The Kloss Model One permits attachment of the IPod. Overall, I highly recommend the Receptor.\",\n",
       " \"GREAT for hard to reach radio signals: I live in Broward County Florida and wasn't able to pull in the West Palm Beach radio station that Howard Stern is on now as I'm outside the stations standard range; not on my regular clock radio or even my stereo. However, the reception on this radio is so GREAT, the signal comes in nice and strong. If you want great reception and sound, get this radio.\",\n",

       " 'Great stuff: Very cool album. I\\'m into a lot of ambient/experimental electronica and this band really created something neat here - catchy vocals amidst very experimental glitches and whatnot.My only gripe is that some of the glitch and bleeps are stock sound files from the Reason sound bank. If anyone is familiar with Reason, listen to the drum kit \"Glitch kit 4\" and you\\'ll find a lot of the sound effects they used there in the first song. I think I\\'d like this album a lot more if I didn\\'t know this or if they made their own effects.Still, a great listen. I\\'m very excited to see what\\'s in store next for them.',\n",

       " \"Challenging but do-able!: Kari's choreography is always fresh and her cuing superb so even for of us who aren't dancers, we can still move along and get a good workout. Like Kari's other videos, Push is designed to be challenging but doable, and I find that each time I do it, I catch one more thing, making the workout that much more fun. Also, with many videos, after doing them repeatedly, you find that the results aren't as good (i.e. your body has gotten used to the type of movement). With this workout, however, it just keeps getting better and better. Don't be discouraged by the pace of the workouts; just keep moving and have a good time. The steps will come with practice. In the meantime, enjoy yourself and have a great sweat.\",\n",

       " 'Fantastic album, but their second is a bit stronger: I really hate how it seems that everytime a metalcore band is starting to hit their stride they go ahead and break up. Deadguy, Kiss It Goodbye, Spread the Disease, Botch...etc. The list goes on and on. Maharahj is on that list too and its a shame for they are probably the very best of all gone-before-their-time metalcore bands. Their debut album is packed end to end with all of that uber-technical yet strangely listenable chaotic noise that fans of this stuff love and Maharahj do it better then just about everyone with few exceptions. They improved on their second album Repetition to a point of near perfection but this album is still more then worth picking up.',\n",

       " 'Hot dance scenes: The dance scenes and the eroticism make this a good movie to watch. I only wish the dance scenes had been edited a bit better. Most of the transitional moves of the dancers have been chopped up or cut. The acting is not that great, but I enjoyed the message of the movie which is to \"let yourself go and feel the feelings!',\n",
       " 'A down and dirty litmus test for Christians: I first read this book as a young Christian and now am impressed with how many of the concepts I have adopted in my own creed. I detest pop Christian symbols and the urge to define a Christian by market forces. Schaeffer attempts to challenge the reader into not only glimpsing in the mirror, but to really make changes accordingly.',\n",
       " 'One of Schaeffer\\'s finest moments: How can a person prove they are a Christian, that their faith is real? This is Schaeffer\\'s question. He seeks Christ\\'s answer and finds it: \"They shall know that you are my followers by the love that you have for one another.\" So the defining characteristic of a believer is that they exhibit love toward other believers. Sounds simple enough but it is, alas, terribly hard to live out in real life. In this brief tome, Schaeffer economically explores the mandatory nature of this quality (\"As I have loved you, you must love one another\" is pretty imperative), how its neglect dooms the church to skeptical reception at best, and examines how one can cultivate such love for fellow Christians. A very important read from one of the 20th century\\'s most important Christian minds.',\n",
       " 'With the length of this book, you have no excuse not to read it: This is a very short book.This is a very good book.Schaeffer\\'s insight put a whole new perspective on things that I had never before considered. Namely: the world has the right to judge Christians based on whether or not they love. You will have to read the book to understand everything Schaeffer uses to reach that conclusion, but I doubt you will be able to argue once you do. Schaeffer explains how love is the not just an element which distinguishes Christians from nonChristians. You will be challenged to re-visit your own heart and determine the truth of John\\'s words \"If a man does not love his brother, the Truth [Christ] is not in him.\"You can read this book in an hour or two, but its thoughts will travel with you for weeks and its impact for the rest of your life.',\n",
       " 'A Powerful Message That Can Be Understood By All: The Mark of the Christian was written almost 40 years ago and has less than 40 pages. Despite the thinness of his book, Pastor Schaeffer presents a critical message that many people who profess to be Christians need to hear. As stated in John 13:33-35, love must be the distinguishing mark of all Christians. He who fails to love has not been truly changed by the gospel message.',\n",
       " 'Relaxation guidance: 3 different relaxation sessions with explanations embedded within, along with hypnotic programing to help release tension, fears and any pre-programmed negatives which might be preventing pregnancy. Also programming for women who have physical problems that might be inhibiting their fertility.

       " \"Awakening: It is easy in this day of age to forget about the troubling aspects that are still facing public schools in our large cities. With this book, Jean Anyon does not let us forget the problems that are still facing these schools today. This book provides a different and important perspective on public school reform in this nation. Anyon does not jump to blame the schools, teachers and students like is done so often when schools fail, but rather she portrays how cummulative effects of school and public officials decisions have tied the hands of the public education reformers in those cities. Anyon's ideas are more comprehensive, and she does not want to just change the schools, but the city itself. This book is very compelling and insightful and offers a great look inside the doors of the public school system in our urban environment.\",\n",

They are trying to get to college and when they do it seem like the whole world is against Jesse, in love,work and college. In fact he notices that society is against the Mexicans in general for work and education. And during these hardships he has to get through somehow.This book relates to me because of the hardships Mexicans and all immigrants are going through now because of prop HR4437.In general the prop represents the people in the book Jesse.just like the prop the people are against Mexicans.

The recipes contain ingredients that are easy to obtain in my somewhat rural area. I really like that the author provides the nutritional information for each recipe (including calories, fat, protein, carbs, fiber, cholesterol and sodium). Although I was looking for a low-carb vegetarian recipe book, I am also concerned with fat and cholesterol content and the recipes in this book also appear to be conscious of those as well. Lacto-ovo vegetarians could easily substitute regular cheese for soy cheese and add eggs to some of the recipes.',\n",
       " \"Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle: I loved this cookbook. My daughter is a vegan and I was concerned that she wasn't getting a balance of proteins in her diet. This cookbook really gives some great recipes from an author who has researched the foods and combinations that give a healthy diet without resorting to high starchy carbs. I will order it for myself as well even though I eat meat. It's always a good idea to include more vegie entres and go without meat as much as possible.

One stopped working and they sent a new one without my having to send back the broken one first! My complaint is that I have to clean the one in the living room at least weekly, rather than monthly as the company says. This may be because I live in New York City and keep the windows open, bringing in lots of dust. And I have a cat. Clean up is pretty simple and fast. The machine is indeed silent, it removes lots of dust and is inconspicuous. I think it improves the air quality quite a bit, of course, more when the windows are closed.

       " 'Buy the Whole Cream: Cream/ Fresh Cream (DCC Gold Disk - 13 tracks): Fresh Cream is a great album. The original U.S. release, however, did not include the song \"Spoonful\", so my advice is to find a version of the album that at least includes that great song. The Gold disk has the 10 cuts from the U.S. release plus \"Spoonful\", \"Wrapping Paper\", and \"The Coffee Song\". As the Gold disk has become SO expensive recently, I would advise a different version of the CD but, as said before, make sure you get one with \"Spoonful\" (in truth, `Wrapping Paper\" and \"The Coffee Song\" are not that necessary to own).',\n",

A treat from start to finish!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+\",\n",
       " 'My favorite Cream Album: Many think that this album is inferior compared to other Cream albums. This is my favorite Cream album, Clapton\\'s guitar work is beyond compare. \"Spoonful\", \"I Feel Free\" and \"Sweet Wine\" show Clapton\\'s talent as a top guitarist as well as his talent as a blues musician on blues songs \"Sleepy Time Time\", \"I\\'m So Glad\" and \"Cats Squirrel\" as well as his lead vocal on \"Four until Late.\" Gingers drumming is also at its peak on his showpiece \"Toad\" as well as doing more than keeping time on \"Sweet Wine\" and others. Jack Bruce\\'s range as a vocalist combined with his talent as a bass and harmonica player are shown on this album more than on any other Cream Album. Though many of the songs aren\\'t original, they sound like no other band when coming from Cream. I would take this album over any other made by Cream, or any other band!',\n",
       " \"Fresh Cream (Cream): A significant piece of rock history. Raw, hard early British rock for the aficianado. Clapton is as good as expected, but give a listen to Ginger Baker's fine work on drums. Album is a fine 'blast from the past.'\",\n",

I, as a Biblical Christian, appreciate the Biblical and godly approach taken to meet the needs of those who struggle with anger and its many forms. I would recommend this book to Christians and to non-Christians who are open to accepting Christ and the Holy Spirit's work in their life, as they seek God's guidance in managing their anger. If a person reading this book is not a Bible-believing Christian or open to that belief, this book is probably not for him/her.\",\n",
       " \"The Anger Workbook--- personal review: I purchased this book quite a few years ago. That was the beginning of learning to control my anger. Note I use the word control, not eliminate my anger. I finally learned why I get angry and react the way I do. I learned anger is not a bad thing--it's just the way you express it that can cause you such hardship. I really appreciate the Christian perspective this book offers. It has blessed me to use the information in this book. It has been about 6 years since I read the book and I can honestly tell you the information, counseling, and techniques really have worked. I highly recommend this book for anyone struggling with anger. There is hope to learn about it, understand why you do it, thus having control of it rather than it having control of you.\",\n",
       " \"I thought this book was GREAT and HELPFUL!: I am a Christian, and I found this book to be very helpful. It touches some personal areas that I wasn't aware of, and it has helped me enormously. I feel like I have a handle on my anger (with God help of course...)now. I recommend this to any Christian who needs it, and I'm sorry if this book offended those of you who aren't Christians. I think it has great basics covered, so even if you aren't a Christian I think it would help.\",\n",
       " 'Excellent Book: I used the Anger Workbook to counsel clients who have anger issues. It is an excellent springboard to discuss anger issues.

       " 'A first-class history of the Israel-Arab conflict: Thousands of books have been written on the Israeli-Arab conflict. Virtually all of these have been partisan. Here we have the first objective history covering the conflict from its 19th century inception right up to the 21st century. \"Righteous Victims\" is not a history of Israel nor a history of Palestine. It is a history of the conflict and it covers the subject comprehensively, objectively and with acute insight. No serious student of the Middle East can afford to ignore this book.',\n",

I got a ton of \"unhelpful\" votes for the above review. My review was not particularly well written, nor spell checked (now corrected!), nor was it detailed. But 17 out of 85 unhelpful? I wonder, wonder what is going on.',\n",
       " \"Broad, excellent overview, but will not please everyone: Like every treatment of the Arab Israeli conflict, this book will not please everyone (or anyone?). The book is brisk. Fortunately, Morris has an even tone throughout and does not remain fixed on any one subject for too long. As anyone knows who has written on a broad topic, this is an exceptional accomplishment. Even at 600 plus pages, this book could have easily gotten bogged along the way on the wealth of detail about this well researched conflict. And this book shows that despite some of Morris' more inflammatory interviews recently, he can still present a work of historical research that is even handed and fair.\",\n",
       " \"Very hard to justify not reading thisbook: This is a fascinating and detailed examination of the evolution of Israel from the perspective of early Zionist aspirations, through to the Hagannah and the IDF. Morris clearly has access to high quality IDF intelligence and archives. While many reviewers have focused on the Arab vs. Zionist sections of the book - presumably because these tensions feed naive political emotions - the text itself devotes a large amount of space to the double dealing by Britain that sowed the seeds of much of the current conflict. In my opinion, an understanding of international subterfuges plotted against, and subsequently thwarted by, a nascent Israel is proably the primary added value of this text. Irrespectove of one's ideological stance, Morris draws together a compelling account of the injustices directed at the early state of Israel (Yishuv). Well worth reading. Packed with detail and certainly not propaganda.\",\n",
       " \"Remarkable work of history: Benny Morris rose to the forefront of Israel's 'New Historians' in the 1980's with the publication of 'Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem,' which provided radically new evidence which altered modern perceptions of the region forever. Morris retains his important findings in Righteous Victims and expands on them, covering virtually the entire history of the Israel-Palestine conflict. I found the earlier chapters leading up to the creation of the State of Israel on the earliest Zionist settlers to be particularly interesting; Morris presents a picture which indicates that the current bloodshed is by no means a product of natural necessity. The ethnic cleansing of Palestine and subsequent military occupation is the cause. However, Morris becomes overly ideological in the concluding sections of the book, allowing his harsh realist politics to creep in. Nevertheless, this is arguably the most comprehensive single volume about the history of the conflict.\",\n",
       " \"Watch out.: There's something in the water in Boston and this year The Red Chord have proved it by following up last year's Boston hardcore/metal masterpieces (Converge's Jane Doe and American Nightmare's Background Music) with a tech metal album that is both accessible and fun yet still innovative. Combining the best aspects of death metal, grind, and hardcore, The Red Chord deliver a disemboweling nine song, thirty minute time signature juggling expose. Incomprehensibly fast and original drumming, technical riffing, and some of the best Godzilla impressions in years are all present. The Red Chord have raised the bar for technical metal on their first release, an astounding feat to say the least.

Sometimes so backwards that you can\\'t even tell what\\'s going and other times so bone-crushing that you have to step away from the speakers for fear of your life, but no matter what the riffs work together perfectly through each song. The guitarist is incredible. The drumming is superb as well, with lots of quick time changes and riffs that are played once, the man on the throne keeps it together and flowing.

My only gripe is that the recording level is a bit low, so you've got to crank the volume quite a bit (still sounds great though, especially w/ headphones).

Although the conductor uses a variety of orchestras, his vision is imparted to whatever band he is conducting and the engineering and acoustics of all the venues are exemplary.It is unfortunate that Georg Tintner committed suicide because of a particularly nasty form of cancer and we are denied his insights into the symphonic cycles of Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler, Haydn, etc.There is being issued in Canada a \"Georg Tintner Commemorative Edition\" and having listened to some of the offerings, his death was a great loss to the world of music and musicology - he wrote his own liner notes to the Bruckner cycle.I highly recommend this set to any Brucknerite as it measures up to and sometimes exceeds the offerings of Jochum - and even von Karajan (no mean feat, indeed!)Timothy Wingate, Ottawa CANADA',\n",
       " \"Bruckner by Jochum: These CDs contain performances of the nine Bruckner symphonies.Of these 3,4,7,8,9 are remarkable, with 4, 8 and 9 beingmasterpieces. The performances by Eugen Jocum and the DresdenStaatskapelle orchsetra are well-designed, and played at tempithat seem to represent the composer's intentions. The recordingquality is good, except for dynamics: the sound volume ison the low side. One needs a high grade system for adequatereproduction, especially given the wide dynamic range andtimbral subtlety characteristic of Bruckner.\",\n",
       " \"Like Hearing Bruckner for the First Time: I have listened to Bruckner for more years than I'd care to admit, but these recordings by Eugen Jochum are like hearing him for the first time. It is startling how good these recordings are, and what freshness Jochum brings to the more familiar Bruckner offerings...the 3rd, 4th, 7th, 8th and 9th. Electrifying is not too strong a word to describe them. In addition, these EMI recordings are an astonishing value. Buy and listen for yourself. I dare you not to be transfigured by the music-making.\",\n",

The periodic injection of real persons such as Bob Dylan, DR. Martin Luther King, etc still working to improve life gives additional substance.',\n",
       " \"A Unique AH: Dubois gets credit for tackling a subject that has not had much alternate history devoted to it -- the Cuban Missile Crisis. Like much alternate history, Resurrection Day has a great setup and a great idea, but the plot itself is strained. It is fascinating to read Dubois's vision of the United States ten years after a limited nuclear war, with President Kennedy maligned as the reason for the nation's collapse. The most original idea is Britain's smug condescension as the U.K. is called upon to offer aid and assistance to the now-impoverished United States.\",\n",
       " 'Resurrection Indeed: Although it starts off a bit meandering, Resurrection Day quickly builds into a book difficult to put down. There are two phenomenal stories here. One is what if the Cuban Missile Crisis had turned into WWIII? The other is what the US might be like as a 3rd world nation. Both are compelling.DuBois writes engaging characters and fills his plot with enough turns to make a Ballerina tipsy. I repeatedly tried to geuss the ending, and even the next page, and was always stymied. The conversations flow convincingly, and the story is a joy to read.Here we are given a look at how Americans are like the rest of the world. If you strip them of the technological advantage, and the moral advantage of a well-constructed constitution that is actually followed, they respond like everyone else.

In places I was amazed to find my experiences described exactly, and the book was always affecting and detailed. However, coming from a situation in which the family came to economic ruin, and lives were destroyed by mental illness, I found the book in some ways too comfortable. A lucky family indeed that is gifted with the money, the isolated farmhouse, and the hired help to manage Maggie's illness the way it is managed! And lucky family whose mother's illness --as we are told at the very beginning of the novel -- is cured. Still, I admired the plainness with which Gibbons told her story, and the fact that she was not tempted -- as the author of _The Daughter of the Queen of Sheba_ was -- into pitching a parent's catastrophic mental illness as an empowering experience.\",\n",

This book not only shows how hard it is for Hattie to deal with her mother's emotional dips, but for her brother, Freddy, as well as her father. Pearl, the loving housekeeper, sometimes seemed to be the life preserver that kept the family afloat. She's a likable character, and it's too bad you don't know more about her. The only complaint I have about the book, or Kaye Gibbons as an author in particular, is the fact that there is not more dialoge in the book.

The only parts that you may need that do not come with the kit are two metric 10mm 1.5 thread pitch bolts - and that is only if you have a 2000-2001 Cherokee.

Very easy install, removing the old rusty exhaust is always the hardest part.One other helpful note - if you have to replace any of the exhaust hangers on your Cherokee due to rust (the rear one in particular), they can be hard to find outside of a Jeep dealer.

The hardest part was taking the old exhaust system off. For this I would suggest using a recip-saw or an angle grinder with a cutoff wheel. In this case I used a recip-saw.Mounting it was easy, just a matter of attaching the clamps and tightening them down. If you have one, I would suggest using an impact driver to do this. It would cut the time needed to install this considerably.The exhaust sounds great at idle and really opens up when you give it some gas.

The second half deals with the \"nuts and bolts\" of the abandonments and methods of attempts to cover it all up.

Serj Tankian with his naive and socially conscious lyrics and hypnotic weird vocal style is destined to become the Bono (U2 vocal) of Nu-metal. This Armenian album will make you hear a style of music that you will not find anywhere else. There are parts in some of the songs that are slower and then when you least expect they change into a heavy, head-banging style.

A fierce rollercoaster can describe the experience with this album.The reason that I gave System of a Down\\'s second effort 4 stars, which is still good, is because of parts of \"Chop Suey\" and \"ATWA.\" It\\'s indisputable truth is that lyrics about \"self-righteous suicide\" and lyrics that speak of a religious matter that isn\\'t correctly grasped (Chop Suey) has a negative connotation, and I don\\'t like to think that anything like that track was overrated; I\\'m not sure why an aspect of \"ATWA\" seemed like a dead man walking (I don\\'t feel/eat anymore).Most of the rhythms on this album were exquisitely done and are fun to listen to like \"Bounce,\" \"Psycho\" and \"Deer Dance.\" Of course, weird lyrics are presented.

That aside, I'll talk about the Album.Musically this CD- although a tad softer than their self titled- is very heavy, and exceptionally good. The vocals are equally as heavy, although pleasingly weird in some parts. The lyrics tackle things from the Prison System (Prison Song), to Spousal Abuse leading to suicidal (Chop Suey!) to Cocaine Crazed Groupies attempting to change their ways (Physcho).

       " \"whatever: Their first album was better. This a good CD, but it lacks the complete insanity of the first one (Sugar, Ddevil, Darts...). The band is starting to head in a more mainstream direction. This CD is good, but I'm worried that they will become progressively more poppish with each album.There are alot of songs on Toxicity, such as Science, that succeed only because of one small section. Science would be a pretty boring song if it weren't for that awesome eastern sounding bit. The songs on the first album didn't need to be patched up to sound cool; they were brilliant to start with.If you don't have the first CD and want to buy Toxicity, do yourself a favor and get the first one instead. Only buy this if, like me, you really like the first one and want more.\",\n",

I read some of the reviews on amazon and were more or less accurate to how I feel about this album. The vibrant 'Prison song' starts the show and sets you up for some serious rocking and it just flows from one song to another so easily. Technically they are brilliant Serj Tankian's voice is so unique and hauntingly changes from madness to mellow in seconds. There are, in my opinion 10 great songs on this album but one to look out for (after the favourites Chop suey,deer dance,Toxicity and Aerials) is 'Forest' the drumming and guitars are mind blowing. Buy this album!\",\n",
       " 'Simple but effective: Having not purchased SOAD\\'s first cd, I had labeled them one-hit wonders after I heard the song \"Sugar.\" When \"Spiders\" became a hit, I was genuinely surprised. When I first heard \"Chop Suey,\" then learned it was from them, I knew 3 songs were no fluke. I picked up this cd the day it came out, and I must say, I have been greatly impressed by this cd. The way they can incorporate Middle-Eastern styles into hard rock is amazing to me, and the vocal talents of Serj are hardly limited to screaming. I can\\'t wait to hear the next offering from these guys, hopefully they can step it up one more notch.',\n",

So pretty soon i downloaded \"X\" and \"Chop Suey!\" off the internet. Within two days I had heard it blaring nextdoor, so i hung out for like thirty minutes by a window listening. Then my brother got one of his friends to burn the cd. The lyrics are so smart, and the aggressive beats are aweosme. You cannot be system of a down no matter how hard you try. The driving guitars, the fast drummming, the good bass. It all comes together, and I think the fact that Serj (singer) is arabian really makes the singing interesting. Buy it! It might scare you if you like JImmy eat Wortld, hoobastank, incubus, linkin park, etc. No rocker should live without it. You dont know what ur missing.',\n",

The best song is Science, other highlights are Aerials, Prison Song, and Chop Suey. Other songs are also good, with the exception of Psycho and Shimmy which may be good live, but are pretty boring on the album. Its worthy.',\n",

Political bands are quite scarce these days, mostly rock music today consists of sex, drugs, and pushing down old people. Prison Songs is widely known for its lyrics ...and law enforcemnt decreased while abolishing mandatory minimum sentences!...

In wich they cleverly candy coat the songs true message about sex, with lyrics about a kid and his pogo stick. Then they have their ballads like \\'chop suey\\' and \\'arials\\' wich are so gracefull you wouldnt expect the upcomming mindshaking metal. System has truly outdone themselves on this album. I hope that you will go out and get this album, its just so fantastic, & if they head to your town W/ Slipknot & Ramstein On \\'The Pledge Of Allegiance Tour\\', make sure your there, otherwise you are going to miss a MIND BLOWING concert',\n",

If you listen to the radio you have probably already heard some of the best songs on this album like: \"Needles\", \"chop suey\", \"toxicity\", and \"aerials\" which are all very good. Toxicity as a whole is very easy to listen thru entirely without really getting bored. and unlike the radio version of aerials the cd version has a 1:30 ending of indian chanting with flute which is kind of wierd... but interesting! so before buying any other s.o.a.d. cds i highly sugest toxicity first. its the most original, most enjoyable, and most unique metal album i have ever heard.',\n",

It\\'ll definitely be on your list of cd\\'s that make you drive about 80 miles/hour on the highway without even noticing. This cd has some heavy material on it, great for unwinding after a long day. There\\'s some serious intensity on this disc that I can\\'t describe in words. I picked up the disc after hearing Chop Suey! and Toxicicty and it\\'s been in heavy rotation in the car ever since.PLUS - You get the bonus DVD with the Toxicity Video and 3 live tracks (Prison, Chop Suey!, & Bounce).If you\\'re looking for somthing heavy, pick this up.

This is a highly reccomended CD!..',\n",

Well, I was very wrong. This may not have been as good as their self titled release but it definatly comes close. This was a great follow-up album and it definatly prooved me wrong. After I heard this album I realized that System would be here to stay for a while. I was anticipating this album very much and was not at all upset. \"Chop Suey\", \"Needles\", \"Toxicity\", \"Deer Dance\" and \"Aerials\" are flawless, perfectly written songs with great lyrics and great music. The only song that didnt really appeal to me was \"Bounce\" because I think they could do a little better with it but the rest of the songs make up for what they lack in \"Bounce\".

Inervision and Toxicity are the best song they've ever made yet in my opinion and based on what I've heard from SOAD. I personally agree with some of the reviewers about heavy metal. I feel that it's a way of expressing your feelings on life and it's more passionate and positive then rap. Heavy metal gives me so much motivation at a level where it's consistent about different things and it's very unlike the bullcrap which is possibly the most listened to source of music out there called rap. I usually listen to jazz, but I would rather prefer this over rap any day because you won't have to worry about hearing money, sex, drugs and b*tches all the time. Although, you may also find negativity in this kind of music.\",\n",

The only problem is that System of a Down isn't all that musical. They tune down their instruments down one step, then just hammer away with no effort. While I do appreciate this album, it doesn't offer that much musical talent.\",\n",

This album never gets old, no one else out there can do what \"System\" does. They are one of the most original bands, doing your own thing can be hard. With the radio full of bands that sound the same, SOAD is the one different band. Other than the radio over played \"Chop Suey!\" the rest of the album is great. If I could give it a 4.5 it would.',\n",

The actual lyrics are not so important. This kind of music would be hard to digest for the shallow mind/taste though.',\n",

There are some awesome heavy riffs with great grooves, however there are still some of the annoying (IMO) vocal interludes.

The other two were too mathematically advanced for me at the time as I was concurrently taking Calc II.The material tends to be covered first in some R dimension using a lot of symmetry to get the main point across and then the second half of a chapter will go into the details in R^3.Compared to its glossy alternative this book was more serious.

It tracks the relationship between Wallace, a clever young man of Portuguese-Cantonese descent, and the family's shrewd, miserly, tyrannical patriarch. Perhaps it's a bit of a fairy tale that works out too smoothly in the end. But Mo writes so well about families - and is so good at capturing the magic of people finding somewhat unexpectedly that they love each other - that it doesn't matter. The scenes between Wallace and his surprisingly resourceful wife May Ling -- and between Wallace and his beloved nephews -- are simply a joy to read.\",\n",

And of all composers for this strange instrument, Rameau is among the most prolific and tastiest. His La Poule is a famous piece, and this performance shows why.When looking at a reissue, among the most important considerations is how well remastered it is. Well, have no fears. Have no fear, said the Cat. The sound is immediate (sometimes a bit TOO immediate) and clear. Clean, fresh, and snappy, you can hear the clicks and pops of the instrument and the performer. Sounds great.My only caveat is that 51 minutes of unaccompanied harpsichord can be a bit much. But the playing is delightful, and full of smiles. Despite the somber picture of Anton Heiller on the sleeve. Good stuff.',\n",

I think folks are judging it to harshly based on the quality of the DVD. I admit, in the beginning the aspect ratio is squeezed together to fit TVs and the picture looks elongated, this is annoying.

The best thing about this book, in comparison with other books in the subject, is first of all that it provides a highly engaging read, and second of all that it offers a very clear solution to our social and environmental problems - to live within and according to nature\\'s limits.

It was wonderful to picture the castle, which looks so cold and austere from the outside, as the home of a warm and loving and joyful family. Children gleefully running through the halls on holidays.

He brings to life a real american hero focusing on both the positive and the negatives of his life. Colt Terry was definitely a hero, serving his country in multiple wars and spending five years under fire. His story needed telling and if you enjoy and learn from history, you will enjoy learning about him.Mr. Patton does a great job helping the reader understand life in the Korean conflict as well as Vietnam. My only critique is that i would have enjoyed more detail and this book should probably have been a bit longer as a result.In conclusion, if you have enjoyed Ambrose then this book should also be sitting on your shelves.',\n",

I second the reviewer who said seek out the version that comes with the b-sides. This record shows bubble gum pop done right, unlike A Broken Frame.

Regardless of how much the film may stray away from the original comic book source material, Constantine is an interesting take on the concept of heaven versus hell. For a first-time director, I have to give some credit for what he was able to pull off and I think the special features give audiences a better understanding of him and his intent.As for as the blu-ray features, there's a hefty amount of filmmaking information that will keep movie fans busy for at least an hour, watching in-depth explanations of how the director approached the design of the film and it's special effects gags.\",\n",

For example, if you see \"Constantine\" with the expectation of Oscar-worthy performances, you are almost certainly going to be disappointed.\"Constantine\" is an entertaining and action-packed ride, and Keanu is a fitting lead actor for the part. The main source of John Constantine\\'s angst stems from a portion of Catholic doctrine that says that suicide is a mortal sin; thus, he is doomed to hell. However, after committing suicide, he was allowed to come back and try to \"atone\" for his mortal sin in any way that he could. This backdrop should allow anyone watching \"Constantine\" to appreciate the depth of the plot while overlooking occasional bad acting. The special effects are great as well as believable, and the ending ties everything up nicely with a bow while at the same time leaving room for a sequel.The fifth star is for the fact that this movie is NOT a remake.',\n",

The beginning when the primary relic that the film focuses on is found was particularly weak, however all of the characters had at least a few good moments with most of them being recognizable without being cliches.Keanu Reeves has more of an edge in playing John Constantine than in most of his previous efforts, but you\\'ll still find yourself waiting for him to call for George Carlin pick him up in his transdimensional telephone booth ala \"Bill and Ted\\'s Excellent Adventure\"',\n",

By tackling recursion and non-linear causation at multiple time scales and cognitive levels, Harrie-Jones helps enrich the recuriveness of population level learning. Bateson was, NO DOUBT, one of the most challenging thinkers of his generation. Struggling at all times to keep his focus on how to make nature and communication more intelligible to more people so that they would have the tools and wisdom to see the consequences of their action on both other people and the planet.

Franklin was a great statesman of his time , and reading about his life and times helps the reader to get inside the mind of this great man. the beauty of the Kindle reader is you can read a few pages, bookmark the page and pick it up again when you get a few spare minutes.In conclusion i would reccomend this book to anybody, who has an interest in learning about the great minds who helped to shape the world we now live in.',\n",

It is beneficial to understand the character of this great man by judging him through his own words. There is no doubt that Franklin was an ingenius man and his witty rhetoric further confirms his intelligence. It also confirms his egotistical nature I hate to say.... But I suppose he had every right given his success...Anyhow, I thought the first portion of the book (written before the revolution) was much more interesting that the latter half. Unfortunately the autobiography was never really finished by Franklin. He ends off abruptly during the French and Indian War period and there is nary an remark concerning American Independence, which would have been interesting to read about from his point of view.Still, overall, it's worth the read.\",\n",

He concentrated on overcoming one character flaw such as his temper and worked on it for a month. Then, he moved on to overcome another character flaw. He made minute but measurable progress to become an accomplished and fine individual.His autobiography should be read by all.

The detail of Breathless - Michel's white shirt and Bogart style cigarette and hat combo, Patricia's striped dresses, he city of Paris, a sharp jazz score, the doomed forebodings of noir - raise this film up to its position as Flicks magazine puts it: the yardstick of celluloid cool.\",\n",

The printer probably needs to take a look at the paper trimmer for their printing press. Several pages were not trimmed properly. Instead they were folded into the book. I had to take some scissors and trim the pages properly..I know that isn't a big deal but you might care if you're getting this as a gift for someone else...Best Regards....\",\n",

He is literally on the ground of the World Trade Center after the planes hit and goes into Iraq with the invasion. There is a certain lack of pretension in his style and I feel that the writing and the photos he gives us are as close to the reality of being there without being there.He is not afraid to present himself as a humanist who is in love with the Army, which I am afraid will be far too complex for many who cannot reconcile that idea. His foibles, screw-ups, less than flattering lights are all in there.He says he has not read books of other wars and I believe him. If he did, the style and degree of openess would be very different. Without trying to be poetic or profound, he testifies to the day-to-day grind of trying to make a difference in the occupation of a hostile land.This is as real as it gets.',\n",

It is great because he\\'s very active and in a transitional stage with toys - too old for stuffed animals but too young conceptually for most toys with a recommended age of 3 and up. I have kept this for an indoor toy for the long winter months. Assembly was simple and at this point, I do not need to add the sand to the bottom to \"weigh it down\", but I might have to as he gets older and plays with the toy more aggressively. Most importantly, my son loves it - it keeps him happy, active and entertained. I hope your cherished little one will like it too.',\n",

The main reason for this particular type of pop-up tent was just that, it pops up. We've had the ones with the poles before and they are such a nuisance to assemble and take apart. These 5 pieces went up in about 8 minutes and were taken down in about 5, you cannot ask more than that. We'll have to see how long they all last, but so far, both boys are having a great time sinking basketballs and pretending whatever it is they pretend.

We plan to move it to their playroom as soon as we do some rearranging in there. The boys have knocked it down playing rough inside the hut. It just pops right back. The setup was super easy. If you don't have a room big enough for the entire play hut then it can easily be setup into two smaller units that are still fun. Great buy. I wished I would have discovered this sooner. This would have really helped out during our snow days and just really cold days when we just didn't leave the house. Also, I plan to take some parts of this unit when we travel this summer.\",\n",

Its not the greatest quality product, but I do not know what other reviewers were expecting (maybe a backpacking tent for climbing Everest?). Overall, I am very satisfied, the construction has held up to pretty intense play, the kids enjoy it, and its ease of use make it a winner for us.',\n",

Our nephew and niece don't use the balls with the set, but they use them separately by rolling them around the room. If you are a parent who can't stand a big mess to pick up, you might want to give your child(ren) the play tent and tunnels and hide the balls somewhere or just give them a few. Set-up is easy.

The tubes are short enough that they don\\'t \"get lost\" or scared and the rooms are fun to bring toys into and play. The ball pit only comes with 50 balls so I definitely recommend buying more. The mesh and holes in the ball pit wall make it fun to play with on both sides and the little basketball hoop is adorable.My only real complaint is the fabric/stitching. The ball pit has higher walls to keep the balls in, but after crawling through the connector tunnels a few times, one of our walls is coming undone. It\\'s still functional, but the balls tumble into the tunnel. Overall not a bad product, especially at such a reasonable price.

The playing is ghostlike. On the fortepiano, the effect is quite chilling and each phrase seems haunted by spirits of the great man himself.The key to all Staier recordings is the use of silence or brief, almost imperceptible pauses which allow the sense of a phrase sink in. He's used this to great effect in his harpsichord recordings of Bach and he re-employs the technique for this recordings of Mozart.In Europe, Staier is considered a modern genius - listen to the Allemende and you'll understand why.\",\n",

The downside was that when I got it home I stumped it 3 times in a row. Maybe it was the magic of the store. The problem comes in that it is hard to answer the questions sometimes because none of the answers fit your word. So you pick the best of the three, and it really does end up throwing off the game.

The ending had a huge effect on me and was symbolic in that life goes on but you will never forget the hardships and the happiness that made you who you are. From the beginning of the book, I felt attached to the serene 1900s Brooklyn setting of the book and I can only imagine the blend of hardship and morsels of happiness that those times brought to a child and his/her family.
